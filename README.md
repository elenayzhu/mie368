This project analyzes U.S. flight and weather data to uncover the key factors driving flight delays and quantify their impact. By combining exploratory data analysis, clustering, and predictive modeling, it identifies context-specific delay patterns and builds models to classify and predict delay likelihood. The insights aim to inform data-driven strategies for improving airline operations, resource allocation, and passenger experience.
